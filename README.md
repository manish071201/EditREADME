This Project is an Real Life Application of Machine Learning Techniques in Medical Field. The main objective is to predict better predictions of Diabetic Result based on Patients' Body following attributes:

**1.** Pregnancies (number of times pregnant)

**2.** Oral glucose tolerance test - OGTT (two hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose in mg/dl)

**3.** Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure in mmHg)

**4.** Skin Thickness (Triceps skin fold thickness in mm)

**5.** Insulin (2 h serum insulin in mu U/ml)

**6.** BMI (Body Mass Index in kg/m2)

**7.** Age (years)

**8.** Pedigree Diabetes Function ('function that represents how likely they are to get the disease by extrapolating from their ancestorâ€™s history')

## What is the need for this Analysis?

Diabetes is a serious health disease due to the presence of high glucose levels in the human body. If diabetes is untreated, it can cause other critical health issues in person.

### Report by WHO (10 Nov 2021)

* The number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.

* Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.
  
* Between 2000 and 2016, there was a 5% increase in premature mortality from diabetes.
  
* In 2019, diabetes was the ninth leading cause of death with an estimated 1.5 million deaths directly caused by diabetes.

* A healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications. The main aim of the project is to predict diabetes by analyzing different human body attributes. The proposed methodology adopts two types of machine learning algorithms for diabetes prediction:

**1.** Logistics Regression

**2.** Supporting Vector Machine

This project discusses important attributes responsible for inducing diabetes. It also computes the correlation between them. The project also compares the performance of different classifiers based on different evaluation metrics.
