This Project is an Real Life Application of Machine Learning Techniques in Medical Field. The main objective is to predict better predictions of Diabetic Result based on Patients' Body following attributes:

**1.** Pregnancies (number of times pregnant)

**2.** Oral glucose tolerance test - OGTT (two hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose in mg/dl)

**3.** Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure in mmHg)

**4.** Skin Thickness (Triceps skin fold thickness in mm)

**5.** Insulin (2 h serum insulin in mu U/ml)

**6.** BMI (Body Mass Index in kg/m2)

**7.** Age (years)

**8.** Pedigree Diabetes Function ('function that represents how likely they are to get the disease by extrapolating from their ancestorâ€™s history')
